With the urgent need to protect Alaska's fishing products valued at
nearly $17 million in 1911, the Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) acquired its
first patrol vessel. In the fall of 1912, the coal-burning steamer
*Wigwam* was purchased for $13,000 from the Alaska Packers Association,
who had previously rebuilt the ship to top condition in compliance with
the Steamboat-Inspection Service's recommendations. Prior to her BOF
service, the "little old steamer" was "one of the first cannery tenders
to operate in the Alaskan salmon packing business."  
(Petersburg Weekly Report, Alaska, VII:17, 4-8-21, p. 1.).  
  
The vessel was renamed the *Osprey* by the Bureau and kept upon the ways
at Semiahmoo, Washington, where it awaited Congressional appropriation
for a crew prior to her commissioning. On 1 July 1913, the appropriation
was effected and seven days later the *Osprey* sailed north to begin
patrol work and other duties in the southeast district of Alaska. Her
six-man crew consisted of the master, engineer, two firemen, seaman, and
cook. By the end of 1913 over 8,000 miles had been logged.

Built in 1895 in San Francisco, California, the *Osprey* was equipped
with a steam winch on the forward main deck and had two masts. The pilot
house area on the boat deck quartered three crewmen, while immediately
beneath was the galley and dinning room on the forward main deck. Six of
the crew could be quartered in the below forecastle and four more could
be accommodated in the after cabin which had folding berths and was
finished in Spanish cedar.  
  
The vessel experienced several difficulties during her service with the
Bureau. A major concern was soon expressed that the engine should to be
converted to oil or gas. With the afterhold being impractical for
holding additional sacks of coal, the *Osprey* had limited bunker space
which allowed stowage for only 7.5 tons of coal. This resulted in a
steaming radius amounting to about 350 miles, much less than the
distance required for the demanded service. Another factor was that the
cost of coal at that time was $8.50 to $12.75 a ton and was usually
obtained at Unalaska on the Aleutian Islands. It was estimated that an
engine conversion would save up to 90% in reduced fuel costs.  
  
In addition, a problem with using coal was that the smoke emerging from
her stack easily identified the ship from afar. This provided an early
warning to those in violation of the fishery laws since there were very
few steam-powered cannery tenders in operation at that time in the area.
The BOF never did replace the *Opsrey's* aging and problematic boiler,
opting rather to make the necessary repairs when required.  
  
  
The Bureau also found it hard to retain good crewmen aboard the vessel
because provisions for subsistence allowances were not included in the
fixed pay rates established by Congress. After paying his mess expenses,
a crewman, who in 1914 was earning $50-$60 a month, found himself left
with too little pay to be considered incentive for employment. The need
was also expressed for the crew to be increased by one or two seamen for
the necessary ship maintenance during the constant running while on
active patrol duty.  
  
Another mark against the *Osprey* was her poor state. After inspectors
George H. Whitney and Peter A. Peltret surveyed the vessel in 1915, it
is believed that she was scheduled to be condemned at Ketchikan, Alaska,
due to her unseaworthiness. She somehow avoided this fate and was kept
in service for another five years.

Over the years the *Osprey* was headquartered in Juneau, Alaska, while
maintaining the enforcement of the salmon fishing laws and regulations
in the southeastern region during summer seasons. In 1916 she was used
at Wrangell, Alaska, for stream investigation work in the spring and
then was sent to Seattle, Washington, in October for repairs. The vessel
remained in Seattle for over a year until January of 1918 when she
returned to Alaska.  
  
In 1918 the *Osprey* participated in two notable rescues in Alaska. Late
in the spring, she towed the boat *Good Tidings* – in danger after
breaking down during a storm – 10 miles to Ketchikan. Then in late
October and most of November, the *Osprey* joined the BOF vessels
[*Auklet* and *Murre*](https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/history/vessels/boats/auklet-murre.htm)
in Alaska to search for bodies from the Canadian Pacific steamship
*Princess Sophia*, which struck Vanderbilt Reef on 25 October, losing
343 lives with no survivors.  
  
In June of 1919, the *Osprey* was transferred to Alaska's central
district where she patrolled until August, at which time she was sent to
be laid up at Cordova. The vessel proved unseaworthy to the point that
no further significant expenditures were made in her upkeep. It was also
decided to condemn the boat and sell her after another year of
service.  
  
The *Osprey* was beached near Cordova in the spring of 1920 to have her
hull cleaned and copper painted. On 25 May, in what seemed like an act
of defiance, the *Osprey* settled in the gravel, fell over on her side
away from the shore, filled with water and was partially submerged. She
remained this way for about a week until the Coast Guard cutter
*Algonquin* was able to render assistance. A scow owned by the Bering
River Coal Company was then used to float the *Osprey* so that the water
could be bailed out of her. For next few months she was used in the
southeast region for summer patrol and salmon stream marking work in
September. She left her Alaska service, towed by the *Auklet* to Seattle
for disposition.  
  
  
The newspapers in Seattle and throughout Southeast Alaska advertised the
14 April 1921 public auctioning of the *Osprey*. Two credible sources
give conflicting details of the sale: 

1.  Poor attendance for the sale produced a high bid of only $515, which
    was rejected as being too low. On 29 June, the vessel was again
    auctioned and sold for $700 – buyer unknown. (BOF Fisheries Service
    Bulletin, May 1921);  
     

2.  "Wrangell, April 14 – The United States Fisheries boat *Osprey* was
    sold at public auction here today to Mayor J.G. Grant for $550."
    (The Alaska Daily Empire, Juneau, 4-14-21)

After the sale it appears that the owner (Mayor Grant?) may have
restored the the ship's name back to the *Wigwam*. Operating as a tug,
she was sold by 1922 to the Foss Launch and Tug Company. Foss rebuilt
the vessel into a more seaworthy tug renamed the *Foss 19*. After her
steam plant was finally replaced with a 180-horsepower Fairbanks-Morse
diesel engine, she began many years of tug duties and general towing in
Puget Sound and Southeast Alaska out of Ketchikan. She became the first
Foss tug to work in Alaska (Skalley).

At the end of the 1930's, the *Foss 19* began hauling oil each year to
communities in Southeast Alaska. Around 1940, her engine was upgraded to
a 200-horsepower Enterprise full-diesel and additional overhauling and
modernizing of the boat's deck house and cabins was done. With this
engine the *Foss 19* often won tugboat races she competed in during the
1950s (Newell).  
  
The *Foss 19* continued her service with Foss until she was sold on 14
May 1965 to Pat Stoppleman who renamed her the *Kiowa* and installed a
replacement D-343 Caterpillar engine. Two years later in 1967, Samson
Tug & Barge purchased the boat and operated her out of Sitka, Alaska.  
  
On 30 October 1978, the tug found herself in heavy weather while pulling
logs in Herring Bay (Frederick Sound, near Ketchikan). The vessel
floundered and sank after logs, which had broken loose from the load,
tore open her stern in the rough sea. Fortunately, the crew was rescued
by another Samson tug before the *Kiowa* was lost (Skalley).

<td style="text-align: left;">The <em>Osprey</em> was considered to be well constructed, however, after the Bureau's Deputy Director, E. Lester Jones, lived aboard her for 60 days during his 1914 inspection of the Alaska fisheries, his opinion of the vessel was unfavorable. In his <em>Report of Alaska Investigations, 1914</em> ( <a href="https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/history/pubs/RAI-1914.pdf#osprey">.pdf, 17.4 MB)</a>  Jones expressed the following:<br />
<br />
"In reference to the unseaworthiness of the <em>Osprey</em>, I feel well qualified to pass judgment, for in my investigations and research this season I lived aboard her for 60 days and found conditions far from satisfactory. Her freeboard amidships is just 12 inches. From the deck to the top of the pilot house the distance is over 14 feet, and with the greater part of her machinery above the water line the vessel is so topheavy that a good breeze renders it dangerous to leave the dock. In an unusual blow last fall, the <em>Osprey</em> without warning turned completely on her side, lying flat on the water long enough for the engine room to be flooded. The officers and crew were penned up in this treacherous boat, and only by an act of Providence did a counter flurry right her in the next few seconds.<br />
<br />
This is the vessel that is offered to our men to patrol 26,000 miles of coast line in boisterous seas to protect the great fishing industry of Alaska. The decks, pilot house, and many of the beams are rotten, and the boat must be handled with unusual care. The boiler is also defective, having been installed 19 years ago, when the boat was built.<br />
<br />
However, I talked with men of experience who are familiar with vessels and their construction, and all admit that her hull is strong and sound and agree that this boat if properly refitted and provided with more efficient machinery would prove suitable for certain requirements of the Alaska patrol service...<br />
<br />
The <em>Osprey</em> has been used only part of the time during the last two years in southeastern Alaska, due primarily to two reasons first, lack of appropriations; and second, because she is unseaworthy and many days unable to leave her dock."<br />
