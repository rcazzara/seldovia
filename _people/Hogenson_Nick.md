(195-2013). He died on June 30, 1988, at the age of 54, and was buried

rescued from a wooden skiff after their 32-foot salmon seiner, "Snug"
swamped and sank about forty miles off the tip of the Kenai Peninsula.
The three were brought to Kodiak by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter. The
skipper of the craft, Simon Josefson, said the boat sank within two to
three minutes after it began taking on water. He said he just had time
to radio a distress message and then all three went off in the skiff.
With them was also Josefson’s 10 year old son John. From Fairbanks Daily
