Her favorite pastimes included playing bingo and black jack, reading about current events, crossword puzzles, and combing the beaches of Alaska for driftwood and artifacts. She loved all wildlife and flora. During her last years she enjoyed watching squirrels, birds, and other wildlife from her living room.

She is survived by her husband, Howard Carlough of Tumwater, WA. Howard and Alyce were devoted to each other and enjoyed living a very active and adventurous life together with family and friends.
