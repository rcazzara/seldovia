Her father, [**Thomas Fox**](../families/Fox_Family.md), was from England. He married Emma
Gardner in Aleutians East, Alaska and they became the parents of nine
children. Emma and the children moved to Unalaska in the early 1930s.

Katherine married **Ernest VINBERG** in 1924 and had five children:
Esther, Ernest, Hubert, Emil and Don Vinberg. In 1934, she married
**Andrew KASHEVAROF** and had five more children: Andrew, Norman, Frank,
Georjean and Diane.

She and her family lived in Unalaska during World War II. On June 3,
1942, the Japanese bombed their home in Unalaska. The family, along with
the other villagers, was evacuated to White Salmon, Wash., until 1944.
When they returned to Unalaska, they found their home in a shambles. Her
husband died in 1945. From 1948-50, Mrs. Kashevarof owned and operated
Kate's Kozy Kitchen, a restaurant and bakery in Unalaska. The family
moved to Seldovia in 1951, and Katherine clerked in Morris's General
Store, and worked in Wakefield Seafoods crab plant. In 1975, a new
108-foot crab fishing vessel owned by Parks & Ringstad was christened
the ''Katie K.'' in her honor. In 1996, she was named CITC's Elder of
the Year and a large 90th birthday party was held in her honor. She had
lived in Anchorage in the Robert Rude Center until her death on March
22, 1998, at the age of 91. She was buried in Seldovia Cemetery, next to
her daughter, [**Diane Helena Kashevarof**](./Kashevarof_Diane.md). Diane died in Anchorage on
October 20, 1959. She was 16 years old.
