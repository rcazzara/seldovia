daughter, Donica Mae was born in Seldovia on December 23, 1968. Ann was
a member of the Seldovia Bible Church. She enjoyed beading, swimming and
the Girls’ Card Night playing Snertz. "Ann was a beloved wife, mother,
grandmother, sister, aunt and loyal friend; a person who cherished
friendships and was eager to share with others. A beautiful person, both
inside and out which was only accented by her beautiful smile. She was
loved, not only by her family, but by an entire community. Through her
long illness she remained positive and tended to be concerned aout those
close to her even more than her own problems." *Seldovia City Cemetery:
