**PHYLLIS JUNE *TOBEY* BALOGH** was born on April 20, 1941 to **Jesse Fay “Harold” and Hazel WILTSHIRE Tobey** on April 20 1941 in Brown City Michigan.  She married [**Michael John Balogh**](./Balogh_Mike.md) in Newport News, Virginia where they were both stationed in the U.S. Army.

She was baptised in the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Anchorage in 1966.  She had been studying in the church in Michigan since 1958 and was living in Seldovia in 1966 when she and her children were flown to Anchorage by a pilot so she could attend the spring meeting: "The evening was climaxed with the baptism of Mrs. Phyllis Balogh who joined the Mission church. Mrs. Balogh first heard the message eight years ago in Michigan and took a number of Bible courses which cul-minated in her baptism. She is now the only Seventh-day Adventist living in Seldovia, an isolated village over one hundred miles south of Anchorage."

Mike and Phyllis died at their home in February 1999.
