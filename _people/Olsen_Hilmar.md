# Hilmar Olsen

## 1879, Norway – August 11, 1959, Seldovia, Alaska

**HILMAR OLSEN** was born, Norway in 1879. In 1910 he was on a ship in
Shelikof Strait. He was living on Kachemak Bay by 1920 and was a fox and
fur farmer then and in 1930 census as well. He was not married until
1943 when he married Hanna Hansen Pedersen, widow of [**Peder Pedersen**](./Pederson_Peter_Emanuel.md) in
Seldovia on January 20, 1943.

From Elsa Pedersen's book "Kachemak Bay Years": Hilmer Olsen of Bradley
River, our first upper-bay friend after he had moved to Seldovia and
before we moved to Bear Cove, came to a tragic end. His wife grew
senile, and her son made arrangements for her to enter a nursing home
and for Hilmer to go to the Pioneer Home at Sitka. He was nearly blind
and would soon be helpless to care for himself. One day he put his old
squirrel-shooting rifle to his head and pulled the trigger. His neighbor
found Hilmer in his woodshed the next morning, still sitting upright,
his life ebbed."
