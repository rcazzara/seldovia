# SOROKOVIKOV/SOROKOVIKOFF FAMILY

The **Sorokovikov** family name came to Alaska from
Irkutsk Russia. Ivan (John) Sorokovikov, born in Irkutsk about 1766 was
sent to the mouth of the Nushagak River to establish and manage the Novo
Aleksandrovski Post of the Russian American Company. Colonial Chief
Manager Hagemeister mentioned Ivan's many years of devoted service to
the Company. After establishing the post he was ordered to leave for
Kodiak and work there for the summer. He later returned to Sitka aboard
the ship Autumn Vessel. By the summer of 1823 he was back in Kodiak.
Ivan and his wife, Maria Antropovna, a Creole, had 8 children. In March
1828 he was the commander of the Karluk, which transported furs, goods
and supplies between the Company's Kodiak District posts. The Karluk was
wrecked during a storm late in 1829. In May 1830 Ivan was reassigned as
a pilot aboard the boat Bobr. At the end of January 1831 he dispatched a
baidara from Kodiak to the Alaska Peninsula with people bound for the
Novo-Alexsandrovskii post. The baidara was lost with all aboard,
including Ivan. The wreckage was found in Zhuravlev Bay. Wrangell
reports that *"Aboard had been 8 employees, 3 of their wives and 4 of
their children, and 12 Aleuts from various settlements. Sorokovikov
himself and sailor Ivan Kolmakov, son of manager of Novo-Aleksandrovsk
redoubt, Fedor Kolmakov, were among them. Also laments the loss of the
Aleuts who are so necessary for the company and whose numbers are
decreasing in the Kodiak district. Lists annual numbers of Aleut deaths
in the Kadiak district from 1825 through 1830. Wrangell intends to look
into the decline in Aleut population when he visits Kadiak this
summer."* Russian American Company, 30 April 1831

Relief measures to be taken for the families left by the company
employees who perished in the \[lost\] baidarka:  (1) the debts of the
deceased are not to be charged to their relatives, but erased from their
accounts; (2) their credit balances are to be used to benefit their
wives; (3) bonuses are to be paid out according to the appended list,
and Sorokovikov\'s wife, out of respect for her husband\'s useful
service and large family, is to receive 1 pound of flour per month for
free and is authorized to purchase 20 funts more. 

Stepan Ivanov Sorokov, son of Ivan and Mariia, b. 1824, d. 1865, married
Tatiana Kompkov. They lived on Kodiak Island and had at least 7 children
including Nikolai 1847. Reader Nikolai Stefanov was the Kenai-born son
of Deacon Stefan Ivanov Sorokovikov and Tatiana Ivanova Kompkova;
educated in a theological seminary in Eastern Siberia. He worked as a
song leader in Kenai from
1875-188730.![](assets/images/SOROKOVIKOV/media/image1.jpeg){width="1.7194444444444446in"

**Konstantine (Conste) Sorokovikoff**, b. January 24, 1871
in Kodiak married Sarafina and had children Sarafina (1903), Nick
(1905), and Andrew (1908). He was a Dena\'ina-speaking lay song leader
who grew up in Kenai and was in charge of a chapel in Seldovia in the
1920s and 1930s. He accompanied the missionary Paul Shadura as an
interpreter between 1908 and 1914. A phrase (\"my own Indian song
leader\") casually uttered by Shadura regarding this Creole-cultural
broker reveals the level of Constantine\'s entrenchment into Dena\'ina
culture. The US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) could not figure out how
to categorize him in their official rosters: on the one hand,
Constantine was involved in local subsistence activities, and on the
other hand, he was performing chapel services. As a result, in their
1934 roster of Seldovia residents, the BIA labeled him as a \"second
priest of Seldovia\". Konste and his wife Anna Berestoff Sorokovikoff
had 8 children:

**Nick Sorokovikoff**: Aug.12,1905- Feb.1968, buried in
