**Robert Purpura**
Longtime Kachemak Bay resident Robert Purpura succumbed to the sea while traveling alone in his skiff from Jakolof Bay to his home in Seldovia. When it was discovered he was overdue many of his friends rushed to search the area. His boat was found adrift with the outboard idling off of McDonald Spit and his body was found floating some distance away.
Robert was born in New York city and raised in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He worked in the food service industry in many places on the eastern seaboard. In the early 1970s he left his position as a maitre d and sommelier at the Country Club in New York and hitchhiked to Alaska. He eventually found his way to Homer and was chef at Land’s End for a time. He was an avid skier and adventurer.
Having a passion for the ocean and small wooden boats, Robert found his way to the south side of the bay and began to set-net salmon in Kasitsna Bay in 1978. A devastating disabling accident happened to him that year. But he picked himself up, met and married his wife in 1980 and continued in the fishery for many years. He and his family lived afloat in Little Tutka until moving to Seldovia 15 years ago. He also made a business of direct marketing salmon for a group of fellow southern district set-netters.
Robert had a remarkable gift for gourmet cooking. He loved to entertain and watch people enjoy his food. For a lot of years he was galley cook extraordinaire on many fishing boats, tugs, rig tenders etc. Robert had taken his cooking to a whole new level recently and was extremely proud of this. He fed his family and friends well.
He was a City of Seldovia council member for a few years and served on various boards and projects. He also served on the Seldovia Fish & Game Advisory Board. Robert’s knowledge, expertise and advice was sought by many. He had a no-nonsense perspective and could get to the gist of any issue.
Robert’s personality was magnetic and he had an amazing sense of humor. He was intelligent, boisterous, sensitive, determined, principled, good-natured, warm hearted, loving and so, so much more. He had a strong work ethic and incredible fortitude. In his life he touched so many people and his passing leaves a huge hole in all our hearts. He was so cherished.
He is proceeded in death by his parents Joseph Purpura and Pauline Caballero and brother in law Marshall Rosi. He is survived by his loving wife of 35 years, Renée Purpura, beautiful daughters Rochelle Hasley and Rosalia Purpura both of whom he was so proud and honored by, his son Jabez LeBret who he hadn’t seen for several years, loving sister and brother in law Rosalia and Cosmo Nardella of Burlington, Mass., brothers Joseph Purpura of Hawaii and Kenneth Purpura of Oregon, and many nieces and nephews.
