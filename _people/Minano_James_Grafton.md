# James Grafton MINANO

**September 23, 1909, Beaver, Alaska – April 7, 1961, Seldovia, Alaska**

**James Grafton MINANO**, "Jim", was born in Beaver, Alaska September
23, 1909 to James **Minano** and Susie **SHUKSHALIK (**various
spellings).

James **Minano**, Sr. was a Japanese trader and whaler who spent 67 of
his life in Alaska and the United States. He left Japan for the first
and last time in 1864 at the age of 11 as a mess boy on a ship. When his
boat was wrecked in Siberia in 1880 he managed to walk the coast to a
spot where he eventually boarded a ship bound for the United States. He
first set foot on American soil at Boston. In 1886 he arrived in
Washington Territory where he obtained his naturalization papers. By
1890 his whaling adventures took him to Alaska. In Barrow, he met up
with a fellow Japanese immigrant, Frank Yasuda and subsequently married
"Susie" Sushalluk, the daughter of a Russian father and Eskimo mother.
By this time the whaling industry was waning but the word of gold being
discovered on the Koyukuk River led the two families on a prospecting
trip to Nolan Creek on the Koyukuk. After a brief stay in Wiseman they
moved on In 1905, they and 3 other men staked Discovery Claim on Little
Squaw Creek, Chandalar district, Alaska. They moved often during these
years, to Carol, to St. Mary’s, to Beaver. The Minanos settled in
Coldfoot before 1916, eventually raising nine children there and
cultivating an extensive gardening operation which sold vegetables to
miners. James was not as interested in mining as in providing services
to the miners. He sawed timber into cordwood for miners to use in their
boilers to thaw frozen ground.

The Minano Cabin at Slate Creek on the Middle Fork of the Koyukuk River
is thought to have been constructed ca. 1915, built of traditional
horizontal log construction. The house incorporated an unusual amount of
sawn lumber (floor boards, ceiling, root cellar walls), which their
daughter Edith describes as being painstakingly sawn by her parents with
a two-man whip saw. The roof consisted of sod laid on planks, typical of
northern Alaska. By 1924, the Minanos were the only remaining residents
in Coldfoot. By 1984, the building was abandoned and in a state of
disrepair. It was then one of only two surviving historic buildings in
Coldfoot. The cabin has since collapsed.

Jim Jr. grew up in Beaver, Coldfoot and Wiseman in a busy era when there
was a great deal of mining activity along the Koyukuk. At that time the
Territorial Government was responsible for the education of white
children: the U.S. Bureau of Education supported schools for Natives.
Territorial statutes required a minimum of 10 white children for
establishment of a school district. The proposed Wiseman district had
only 8, but with the Minano offspring (Japanese/Native mix) there were
12. When Ben Moses, the teacher at Koyukuk Station heard that Jim and
Walter were not going to school, he arranged to have them sent from
Coldfoot to Eklutna on the Teddy H. Soon after, James Sr. grew homesick
for his sons and, taking Buddy with him, left the rest of the family in
Coldfoot and moved to Eklutna in 1927.

By the 1930 US Census, Jim and Walter had finished school but they were
still living in Eklutna, where their father was a cook for the Alaska
Railroad. At the same time Jim is listed separately in Anchorage as a
gold miner.

In the spring of 1942, just months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
more than 100,000 residents of Japanese ancestry were forcefully evicted
by the army from their homes in Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona
and Alaska, and sent to nearby temporary assembly centers. From there
they were sent by trains to American-style concentration camps at remote
inland sites where many people spent the remainder of the war. On April
28, 1942 James Sr. was evacuated from Alaska an interned in Camp Harmony
near Puyallup, Washington. He died June 5, 1942 at the Camp Harmony
hospital. James Minano, Sr. was survived by five sons, four of whom were
serving in the United States Army. The fifth, Henry (Hope), was living
with the Foode brothers in Area A. The body of the deceased, cremated at
Tacoma, was shipped to friends in Anchorage, Alaska. (This is from the
Camp Harmony newsletter.)

At the same time that he was being interred, his sons were conscripted
into the US Army. James, Jr. who had been an employee at Libby Cannery,
enlisted in the US Army in April 1942, listing his residence as Kenai,
Alaska. He was listed as single, Japanese with US citizenship, and
having a grammar school education. He was enlisted "for the duration of
the War or other emergency, plus six months, subject to the discretion
of the President or otherwise according to law".

US General Land Office records list James G. Minano as owner of a tract
of land in Kenai. He also was the owner of a fishing boat named "Polly"
that had been built in Seldovia.

In January 1948, while living in Kenai, Jim Minano was involved in the
apprehension of a murder suspect Bill Frank(e) there. Jim alerted the U.
S. Marshall Alan Peterson that there had been a murder and was deputized
with several others to find the suspect. Despite the possibilities posed
by the accumulated manpower and firepower, the conclusion was
anticlimactic: The accused, William "Bill" Frank, surrendered to the
marshal, was taken into custody, and freely admitted to killing Ethan
Cunningham after an argument. There is still speculation as to the cause
of the murder and most agreed that it was a jealous husband. After the
murder Martha Cunningham moved to Anchorage and became a nurse. She was
briefly remarried and then divorced, returning to her first married
name. Before she died, in 1973, Martha Cunningham made a gift to the
City of Kenai that has kept alive her Alaska family name. In August
1971, she offered to donate a two-acre tract of her homestead land on
the Kenai River to be used as a public park and to be named Cunningham
Memorial Park. Council members unanimously voted to accept the offer.

James Grafton Minano died April7, 1961 Alaska at the age of 51. He is
buried in an unmarked grave in the Seldovia City Cemetery, Lot \#168.

Minano, James (1858-1945 {*actually 1942*}). James Minano was born in
Hiroshima, Japan sometime around 1858. Like his old friend Frank Yasuda,
Minano made his way to Alaska by hiring on as a laborer on a whaling
ship (around 1900). He was shipwrecked off the coast of Siberia and he
made his way to Barrow by foot and by hiring local natives to bring him
across the Bering Straits. In Barrow, Minano met and married a woman
from Point Hope named Shushalluk (Susie). He also reconnected with his
friend Yasuda and when word of gold in the Koyukuk reached them, the two
men and their families made their way to Nolan Creek. After a brief stay
in Wiseman, the Minanos again moved with Yasuda to Chandalar Lake.
During the next few years, the Minanos moved often; to Carol, to St.
Mary’s Creek, to Beaver (1908). Minano never became a miner. Instead he
cut wood for those too busy to do it themselves, ran a roadhouse and
cooked \[Warbelow 1993\]. Sometime before 1916, Minano moved his family
to Coldfoot where he planted a garden and raised vegetables to sell
\[Will 1981\]. Around 1927 Minano left his wife and younger children in
Coldfoot and moved to Eklutna where his older sons were living
\[Warbelow 1993\].When the residents of Wiseman and Coldfoot decided to
ask for funds to have a school built, they went to Minano and asked him
if he would be willing to sign his kids up, even though they were not
all really old enough. This he did, triggering something of a debate
back in Juneau, because the law stipulated that the children should be
white. In the end, the educational bureaucracy was convinced that being
half Japanese was close enough and the school was approved. During the
1920s, several of his children attended school in Wiseman \[Ulen
1983\].Despite the fact that three of his sons fought in the US Army,
Minano was sent to an internment camp in Seattle during World War II
where he died in April 1945 \[Warbelow 1993\]
