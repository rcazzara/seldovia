# Craig "Higgy" Higman

## 1945– June 19, 2016 Seldovia, Alaska

**CRAIG HIGMAN, "Higgy"** passed away on June 19 in Homer, by the side of
his son, Bretwood "Hig" Higman. He had been out for a walk in Seldovia,
his home for 39 years, when he fell and hit his head. By the time he
reached the hospital in Homer he was non-responsive – a quick and simple
end that no doubt would have appealed to his "I don’t like complicated"
philosophy. He lived a life full of fireworks, creative vision,
misadventures, flagrant disregard of mortal limits, fine wood
craftsmanship, cheap beer, and love. He is survived by his ex-wife Dede,
children Valisa and Hig, brothers Jim and Terry, sister Jill, and
grandchildren Katmai and Lituya, and a community of people that blurred
the line between family and friends.

Higgy is remembered with intemperate love by those who knew him – for
his stunning craftsmanship, deep humor, genuine and unconventional
honesty, his explosions, and for the indelible marks of joy, beauty, and
creativity that he left. Wise from a lifetime of following his heart, he
always accepted what life threw at him, embraced changes, and made sure
his children knew that no matter what, he loved them. His story telling
knew no equal, his kindness knew no bounds, and his character was,
without question, in a class of its own. He joins his mother Hona who
learned to bungee jump at 80, his father Bopa who built boats and
planes, and a pack of beloved dogs.
