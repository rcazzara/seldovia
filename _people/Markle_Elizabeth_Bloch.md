**ELISAVETA *BALLISHOFF8 BLOCH MARKLE** was born about in 1884 or 1885 on the
Kenai Peninsula. She married [**Adam Bloch**](./Bloch_Adam.md) on September 9, 1900 at Saint Nicholas Chapel (aka Russian Orthodox
Church) in Seldovia, Alaska by Reverend Ivan E. Bartnovsky. They had 4
children, daughters Susan BLOCH English (1904-1986), Mary BLOCH,
Fredrika "Rika" BLOCH Risoff (1906-1998) and son Adam Phillip BLOCH
(1914-2000).

Adam Bloch died in 1915, and on November 13, 1916 Elizabeth married
**Harry Alfred Markle**, in Seldovia. 

By her second husband she had two known children: 1) **Elizabeth
"Bessie" MARKLE**; and 2) "Baby" MARKLE. Her only grandchildren came
from her eldest three known children. Her death certificate indicates
that she died in Anchorage of a puerperal infection, i.e., puerperal
sepsis, a condition that arises from childbirth, and that she had been
treated for this, presumably after having been taken to Anchorage, from
5 May to 11 May 1920. The condition was indicated as having existed for
14 days. Her death certificate also indicates that she was buried in
Anchorage on 13 May 1920, but this is believed to be erroneous, as she
and both of her husbands lived in Seldovia, her first husband is buried
in the Seldovia Hillside Cemetery, and her own marker is in that
Hillside Cemetery as well. Her infant daughter is buried beside her.

After her death Harry moved back to California and Elizabeth’s children
were taken in by their half-siblings from Adam Bloch’s first marriage,
the Johansen and Simmons families.
