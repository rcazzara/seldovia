**ROY LOUIS HANSEN** was born August 25, 1926 to William C. and Grace
Dahlgren Hansen. His father was from Denmark.

At the time of Roy’s birth, the Hansen family lived in what is now the
ghost town of Katalla, Alaska, in the Valdez-Cordova area. Katalla was
at the center of the now-abandoned Katalla oil field. This was the first
discovery of commercial quantities of oil in Alaska (1902). The town
reportedly had a population of 5,000 in 1907-1908. The famous "ship of
gold" *SS Portland*, ran aground and sank at Katalla in November 1910,
during an autumn storm. The town's population continued to depend on the
small oil field for income until December 25, 1933 when fire damaged its
refinery and operations ceased. The town's post office closed in 1943
and the town site was abandoned.

The Hansen family moved from Katalla to Cordova when Roy was four years
old. He attended school in Cordova and was in the US Army during WW II.

Roy married [**Lucille OLLESTAD**](./Hansen_Lucille_Ollestad.md) in Seldovia
in 1953 and they had 3 sons and 5 daughters.

Roy was a commercial fisherman. He and his son Roy survived the sinking
of the vessel Glacier King in Bristol Bay in 1977.

He was a member of the Seldovia Native Association and the Cook Inlet
Regional Association. He lived in Anchorage, Alaska after 1981 but was
buried in Seldovia, next to his wife, Plot \# 222.

Daughter Sandi Hansen, who died in Anchorage in 2018, was the mother of
[**"Baby Groothof"**](./Groothof_Baby_Boy.md) (1975-1975) who is buried in the Seldovia City
Cemetery.
