**Steve   Agenia** was born about 1890 to Stepan and Parascovia Agenia somewhere on the Kenai Peninsula, perhaps in English Bay. He was living in Seldovia in 1930.  He died of tuberculosis in Seldovia on June 8, 1938 and was buried that same day. He may have been buried in the lower cemetery and removed to Seldovia City Cemetery at the time of relocation.
