**Asiente "Musik" Romanoff's** WWII draft card carries the note: "This man has never attended school one day. He cannot read or write. Cross-eyed.

Musik was the son of **Asiente Romanoff** was born about 1912. He was the brother of Barbara Romanoff (Beach). Althouh the City records list Musik as having been buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery, Plot #169, there is not date recorded for his birh or death. 

Perhaps the reason he was called Musik was because he was a notorious harmonica player.  

Mae Annette Fox Sharp says "We called him Moosic.  His name was Arsenti Romanoff, and his family came from Kodiak.  He never had a home or family, but lived everywhere.  He could barely see, and always seemed to look the same age.  He did odd jobs for everyone and everyone fed him and gave him a place to sleep.  He had an accordion, which he played by ear. He gave me an old one of his and I would play along with him, not knowing a note of music, but we made a lot of noise, with guitars that no one could play, banjos, and a piano.  We managed to get a few knocks at the door asking us if we were having a party.  We had a lot of fun.  He also taugh us how to play flip the coin, heads or tails.  I remember cheating on this one, and I'm sure he knew it as we all won when we played with him." From "My Seldovia - My Life".
