# Giles Family

**The many GILES family members in Seldovia originate here from two
brothers, [**Fleming James Giles**](../_people/Giles_Fleming_James.md) and [**Larry George
Giles**](../_people/Giles_Larry_George.md), who were born to George M. Giles and Agnes
Ramsey. George and Agnes were both born in Washington, but married in
British Columbia, Canada, and their children were born in Washington,
Montana and Canada.**
