# HOLMSTROM Family

**Gustave Edvard Holmstrom** was born in Finland in 1881.  By 1910 he was living in Kenai, Alaska.  The census record lists his parents as both being born in Sweden. IN 1920 Gus was in Seldovia and married to [**Anna
Walnusson**](../_people/Holmstrom_Anna_Walmusson.md), daughter of Stephen Walnussen. In 1920 he also received his US Naturalization papers. 

When Gus died in Seldovia on November 7, 1934, the Juneau Empire published the news, calling him "Contrary Gus". 
"Gustav Holstrom for 30 years a resident of Seldovia passed away on the 7th from sudden attack of heart failure.  He was a native of Finland and about 54 years of age.

Mr. Holstrom, who had appeard in his usual health, dropped dead during the noon hour while on his way to his home.  The funeral service was held on Friday, November 9, with burial in the Seldovia cemetery.  He is surived by Mrs. Holstrom, a daughter and two sons.  Relatives, it is believed, ive in Finland.

As fisherman and cannery worker, Mr. Holstrom had been employed by practically every cannery on Cook Inlet in his service with the San Juan Fishing & Packing Co., covering a span of years.  Last season he worked at Nellie Juan and then the company operated on Kachemak Bay where he was regularly employed, his special post being that of pile driver man.  Before coming to Cook Inlet he fished on the Columbia River with headquarters at Astoria, Oregon.

A kindly, jovial man, he was hailed by the good-natured title of "Contrary Gus" and as a friendly neighbor and resident will be sadly missed by the community."

HOLSTROM BOUND OVER TO GRAND JURY
Bonds of Man Accused of Shooting at Seldovia Fixed at $1,000.
Gus Holstrom was bound over to await the action of the grand jury this morning on the charge of shooting with intent to kill a Native near Seldovia nearly a year ago. Commissioner Conroy fixed the bonds at a thousand dollars. According to what came out in court the Native and Holstrom had a fight. The native grasped an axe and a gun went off, the bullet from which, the Native says, hit him on top of the head. Holstrom says they fell over the gun while they were struggling and that it went off accidentally. L. V. Ray, counsel for Holstrom, declared that it would be impossible for a bullet to hit the Native if a gun were held in the hands of Holstrom in the manner described by the Native.  Holstrom has been working near Seldovia for the Goose Bay Cannery since the occurrence.
